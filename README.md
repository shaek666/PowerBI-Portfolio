# Power BI Projects Portfolio

Welcome to my Power BI Projects repository! This repository showcases my diverse data analysis projects, presented with comprehensive organization and attention to detail. These projects represent my expertise in Power BI, data visualization, and business intelligence, demonstrating real-world insights across various domains.


## Why GitHub and Not a Portfolio Website?

As a full-time student nearing the end of my university journey, I am excited to pursue professional opportunities in the field of data analytics and business intelligence. However, financial constraints as a student have made it challenging to afford premium tools like **Microsoft Fabric** and the costs associated with creating a personal portfolio website, such as domain registration and hosting. Additionally, international payment limitations have added to the complexity.

This GitHub repository serves as a transparent and accessible solution, allowing me to share my work effectively while highlighting my skills and dedication. I hope this approach not only communicates my capabilities but also demonstrates my adaptability and resourcefulness.

Each project in this repository is carefully structured for clarity and ease of navigation. The following folders are present in each project directory:

   - Contains snapshots of the Power BI reports, dashboards, and any relevant visual assets (e.g., icons if applicable).
   - These assets provide a quick overview of the report's visualizations and structure.

2. **Data**

   - Some projects feature **SQL scripts**, showcasing my ability to work with relational databases and perform complex queries.
